## Introduction

### Preamble

An important part of collectible card games is to be able to track and maintain game details and results. Classic methods of keeping track of important game information may include pen & paper, dice, or tokens, all of which have many limitations, and make it difficult to easily store and retrieve past or current game information. With so many people having information technology devices available to them, it seems that better methods for tracking and storing game information can be developed.
